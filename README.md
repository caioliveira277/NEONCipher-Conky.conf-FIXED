# NEON-Cipher-Conky.conf-FIXED
Converted the config.conf from http://neoncipher.net/v/conky/

Origional file setup credit goes to Neon Cipher.
I just converted it to be compatible with the newer syntax.

Just remember to change the title, your network adapter name, and how many cores for your system.
My conf is set up for an 8 core CPU
